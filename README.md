## Detailed Documentation of Each Stage and Analytical Approach Used Throughout the Project Lifecycle

### Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of historical sales, customer, and shipping data for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), a leading office supply and furniture retailer having their headquarters located in Lagos, Nigeria. The analysis focuses on supporting strategic decision-making for the Abuja Division using real transactional data from 2009 to 2012.

The goal of this case study is to uncover key insights related to sales performance, customer profitability, logistics efficiency, and regional trends, leveraging SQL Server for data importation, cleaning, transformation, and querying.

The project is divided into two main scenarios:

  - Case Scenario I: Operational Performance which focuses on product categories, regions, shipping costs, and low-performing customers.
  
  - Case Scenario II: Customer Value and Profitability, identifying high-value and returning customers, analyzing segment behavior, and evaluating order priority vs. shipping cost alignment.

Each question in the case study is solved using structured SQL queries, followed by interpretations that include:

  - Actionable insights
  
  - Practical decision tips
  
  -	Strategic business recommendations

This analysis demonstrates how SQL can be used to power data-driven decision-making, improve customer segmentation, reduce operational costs, and strengthen the competitive position of a growing retail organization.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining a dataset to uncover:

  -	Patterns
  
  -	Relationships
  
  -	Anomalies
  
  -	Key trends
  
It involves asking open-ended questions to understand what the data is telling us, before proceeding into complex modeling and/or final decisions.

### Purpose of EDA in This KMS Case Study

In this case study, EDA was essential to:

1.	Understand the structure of the raw data (e.g., column types, missing values, date formats).

2.	Identify key variables relevant to business outcomes:

    -	Sales, Profit, Region, Product Category, Customer Segment, Order Priority, Shipping Cost.
  
3.	Detect inconsistencies or outliers (e.g., negative profits, unusually high shipping costs).
	
4.	Uncover early business questions, such as:

    -	Which products are driving revenue?

    -	Which customers generate the most value?
  
    -	Are expensive shipping methods being used for low-priority orders?

### EDA Application

In this project, EDA was conducted using SQL Server, and included:

  -	Running SELECT and GROUP BY queries to summarize sales and profit by category, region, and segment.

  -	Using COUNT(), SUM(), and ORDER BY to explore distributions.
    
  -	Filtering with WHERE to focus on specific subgroups (e.g., only â€˜Small Businessâ€™ customers or only â€˜Ontarioâ€™ province).
    
  -	Identifying potential return activity by detecting negative profits.

### Impact of EDA in This Case Study

EDA helped shape the direction of the analysis by:

  -	Revealing top-performing categories and regions.

  -	Identifying inefficiencies in shipping cost usage.
  
  -	Highlighting customer segments that need targeted strategies.
  
  -	Informing clear business recommendations backed by data.


### Step 1: Creation of Database and Data Importation

Approach:

create database DSA_PROJECT_DB

Used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Import Wizard to load the KMS Sql Case Study.csv file into a table named DBO.[KMS Sql Case Study].

Actions:

-	Right-clicked on the target database â†’ Tasks â†’ Import Flat File.
  
-	Set data types, adjusted column names, and validated data rows.
  
Column,	    Data Type,   	     âœ… Notes

Row_ID,         int,           âœ… Set as Primary Key

Order_ID, 	    int,           	âœ…

Order_Date, 	  date,	          âœ…

Order_Priority, 	nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Order_Quantity,	  tinyint,	âœ… 

Sales,	  decimal(18,2),	âœ… 

Discount,  	decimal(18,2),	âœ… 

Ship_Mode,	  nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Profit,	  decimal(18,2),	âœ…

Shipping_Cost,  	decimal(18,2),	âœ…

Customer_Name,	  nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Province,	  nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Region,	  nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Customer_Segment,  	nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Product_Category,	  nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Product_Sub_Category,	  nvarchar(50),	âœ…

Product_Name,	  nvarchar(100),	âœ… 

Product_Container,	  nvarchar(100),	âœ…

Product_Base_Margin,	  decimal(18,2),	âœ… 

Ship_Date,	  date,	âœ…


Outcome: 

Clean, structured table with 21 fields (Order ID, Customer Name, Sales, Profit, Order Priority, Ship Mode, etc.).

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

Approach:

Applied SQL data validation techniques to correct column names, check for nulls, and ensure proper data types.

### Key Fixes:

-	Checked for null via this query prompt
  
SELECT 

  COUNT(*) AS Total_Rows,
  
  COUNT(Order_ID) AS Order_ID_NotNull,
  
  COUNT(Customer_Name) AS Customer_Name_NotNull
  
FROM DBO.[KMS Sql Case Study];


-	Checked data type using sql query
  
SELECT 

  COLUMN_NAME, 
  
  DATA_TYPE 
  
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 

WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'DBO.[KMS Sql Case Study]';


Outcome: Clean and query-ready dataset.
